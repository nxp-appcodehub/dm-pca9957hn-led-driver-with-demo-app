## PCA9957HN led driver with demo app running on FRDM-MCXN947 or FRDM-MCXA153

PCA9957 is a daisy-chain SPI-compatible 4-wire serial bus controlled 24-channel constant current LED driver optimized for dimming and blinking 32 mA Red/Green/Blue/Amber (RGBA) LEDs.

This demo application provides a command line interface which allows the user to easily explore the different functions of the driver to use the LED controller features for color mixing, group gradation, blinking and dimming LEDs.

## 5. Know Limitations

 - PCA9957HN-ARD sometimes detects faults (short circuit) on different LED channels when supply given by base board so It is recommended to use external supply (3V - 3.3V) on J1 (To use external supply Please connect pin number 2 and 3 of J2).
 - Use Stackable Female Header Connector to connect base and shield board, so it gets stacked properly.
